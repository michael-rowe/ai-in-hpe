# Agency in Learning with AI

The relationship between artificial intelligence and learner agency presents unique opportunities and challenges in health professions education. While AI systems require human initiation to begin any learning process, the question of *who* initiates that process is crucial.

## Beyond teacher-centred AI integration

Traditionally, discussions about AI in education focus on how teachers can use these tools to:

- Design curricula
- Create learning materials
- Develop assessments
- Structure learning experiences

However, this perspective often overlooks a fundamental shift: learners themselves can now harness AI to support their educational journey.

## Student agency in the AI era

Health professions students are increasingly taking ownership of their learning through AI tools. This shift raises important considerations:

### Student-initiated learning

- Students can create personalized study guides
- Learners may generate practice questions
- Self-directed exploration of complex medical concepts
- Customized learning pathways based on individual needs

### Implications for educators

- Moving from content delivery to learning facilitation
- Supporting students in effective AI tool use
- Developing critical evaluation skills
- Creating environments that embrace student agency

## Reframing the discussion

The central question isn't whether AI aligns with traditional teaching methods, but rather how it can expand access to learning and support diverse educational needs in health professions education. This shift requires educators to consider:

- How to empower students as active agents in their learning
- Ways to integrate AI tools thoughtfully and ethically
- Methods to support self-directed learning
- Strategies for developing critical thinking in an AI-enhanced environment

## Looking forward

The future of health professions education lies not in restricting AI use, but in embracing its potential to enhance learner agency while maintaining educational integrity and professional standards.
