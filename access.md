# Access to generative AI

When we talk about access we're really talking about two different kinds of access; *physical* and *epistemological*.

## Physical access

Physical access to generative AI is the simplest version. It refers to the hardware (phone, tablet, laptop, Humane AI pin, etc.), software (apps like ChatGPT and Perplexity, or simply the browser installed on the hardware), and an internet connection that enables you to access generative AI.

## Epistemological access

Epistemological access is different. It refers to your ability to make use of the affordances provided by the technology. It recognises that, just because you have a device, an internet connection, and an app installed, doesn't mean that you can successfully use generative AI to do something useful. You can also think of this as [AI literacy](ai-literacy.md)
