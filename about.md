## Rationale for the project

I've been conscious of the fact that most of what I've learned about generative AI has been haphazard and ad hoc. Basically, whatever shows up in my feed (blog posts, podcasts, Twitter, etc) is what I've paid attention to. While I have spent time building that feed, I haven't had any direction or goals that would help to make my exploration and learning more intentional.

So I've started putting together a programme of study that would provide a framework for what I learned, making it more structured and guided.

You could think of this as an opinionated guide to generative AI in health professions education. For now, it's mostly my opinion but I'm hoping the project picks up collaborators along the way, so that it becomes more a shared sense-making experience. And therefore, a wider diversity of opinions.

**What the project is not:**

- A collection of content or dump of information.
- An uncritical praising of all things AI.
- What the future *could* be i.e. this is about what is, today.

## Technology choices

I considered creating a section of my blog ([/usr/space](https://www.mrowe.co.za/blog/)) to capture what I was learning but I worried that I'd be spending a lot of time messing around with the CMS part of a website. I do most of my writing in Obsidian and thought it would be a hassle to move content from there to WordPress.

I've been wanting to learn more about *static site generators* for a while, after having come across them in 2023 while thinking about another project, but haven't had an excuse to figure out how they work. And I've also wanted to explore [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as a free option for publishing my notes (I wasn't going to pay for Obsidian Publish).

Choosing to create the site in Github Pages also means that it's possible for anyone to contribute. Since this is about making sense of generative AI in health professions education, I thought it'd be useful if it wasn't just my opinions (and biases) that get included in the project. You can find out more about [participation here](./participate.md).

In addition, I think there may be some interesting options down the road, when it comes to actually running working code as part of the process. Instead of just being a collection of information about generative AI, I'm wondering if this is something where people can actually experiment with the technology. I don't know yet if this is even possible, but I like to think that using Github makes this more likely than if I'd chosen WordPress.
